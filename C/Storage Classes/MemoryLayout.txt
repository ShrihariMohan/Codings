1. Text Segment: ( cs )

A text segment , 
also known as a code segment or simply as text is one of the 
sections of a program in an object file or in memory, 
which contains executable instructions.

a = 10 ;
a = 5 + 5 ;

2. Initialized Data Segment: ( ds )

which contains the global variables and static variables 
that are initialized by the programmer.

static int a = 10 ;
int a = 10 ;

3. Uninitialized Data Segment: ( bss ) -> block started by symbol ;
For instance a variable declared static int i; 
would be contained in the BSS segment.
int i ;



For instance a global variable declared int j; 
would be contained in the BSS segment.

4. Stack: ( ss )

Stack, where automatic variables are stored, 
along with information that is saved each time a function is called.
Each time a function is called, the address of where to return to and 
certain information about the callerâ€™s environment, 
such as some of the machine registers, are saved on the stack. 

Auto Var , Function calls , return values , Parameter Vars 

int test(int a , int b) {
    return 10 ;
}
void main () {
    int a ;
    test();
}


5. Heap : ( hs )

Dynamic memory allocation
